# Grapple Game Engine

## Building

Run `/scripts/Windows_GenerateProjects.bat` to generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution.

### Dependecies

1. Vulkan SDK 1.3. `VulkanSDK/<version>/bin/` must be added to `PATH`. `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable must be set to `/VulkanSDK/<version>/`
2. Assimp is not included in the solution, and is built separatly as a static lib.
    Run `/Grapple/vendor/assimp/GenerateAssimpProject.bat` to generate a Visual Studio solution and build both Debug & Release configurations.
3. All other dependecies, are included as submodules and are a part of the Visual Studio solution.

### Sandbox

Run `GenerateProject.bat` inside `/Sandbox/`, to generate a solution.
